        <p> I grew up in the incredible, often grey and beyond uncomfortably-cold, crime-ridden city known as Chicago. The food
            scene and summertime festivities is what makes it all more than worthwhile. However, with a core temperature
            comparable to a lizard, Chicago winters were especially brutal. That's why, when the opportunity to move to Austin
            presented itself, I jumped on it. Of course, this meant, at the age of 26, I finally needed to learn how to drive.

        <p>I've spent most of my working career in leadership roles at food-related environments. From managing the cafeteria
            at the
            <a href="https://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/">second oldest law school in Chicago</a>, to holding a management role at a Chicago founded and based
            <a href="http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-chicago-based-mt-food-service-inc">food distribution company</a> with annual net sales of $50M. Since moving to Austin, I served a short stint as
            an Administrative Assistant at a
            <a href="http://www.servprohydeparkcentralaustin.com/">Residential and Commercial Restoration company</a>. This position included filing insurance claims and required
            an
            <a href="https://www.iicrc.org/">IICRC</a> certification in Water Damage Restoration, in addition to the corporation's multiple internal certifications.
            For the past 5 years I've put those driving skills to use, commuting 40 miles roundtrip, to serve as the Administrative
            Assistant & Application Processor for the
            <a href="www.ltisdschools.org/FANS">Food & Nutrition Services Department</a> at a public school district in the Hill Country. Least we forget, I
            entered the district in the roll of a bouffant hairnet wearing lunch lady for a few months before quickly realizing
            I prefer standing desks to standing on my feet all day and that I have little to no rapport with elementary-aged
            children.
